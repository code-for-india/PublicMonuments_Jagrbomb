Android Beacon Library
=======================

An Android library providing APIs to interact with beacons  

## Changes from the 0.x library version

This library has changed significantly from the 0.x library version and is now designed to work with
open AltBeacons which fully support Android without any intellectual property restrictions.  For
more information on how to migrate projects using the 0.x APIs to the 2.x APIs, see
[API migration.](api-migrate.md)

**IMPORTANT:  By default, this library will only detect beacons meeting the new AltBeacon specification.**

If you want this library to work with proprietary or custom beacons, see the [BeaconParser](http://altbeacon.github.io/android-beacon-library/javadoc/org/altbeacon/beacon/BeaconParser.html) class.

## What does this library do?

It allows Android devices to use beacons much like iOS devices do.  An app can request to get notifications when one
or more beacons appear or disappear.  An app can also request to get a ranging update from one or more beacons
at a frequency of approximately 1Hz.

## Documentation

The [project website](http://altbeacon.github.io/android-beacon-library/) has [full documentation](http://altbeacon.github.io/android-beacon-library/documentation.html) including [Javadocs.](http://altbeacon.github.io/android-beacon-library/javadoc/)

## Binary Releases

You may [download binary releases here.](http://altbeacon.github.io/android-beacon-library/download.html) 

## How to build this Library

IMPORTANT:  This project now uses an AndroidStudio/gradle build system and the source code may no longer be imported into Eclipse as a library project.
Eclipse users may download the latest release binary as a tar.gz file, which may then be imported as an Eclipse Library Project.  See the quick start on the project website for more information.
